📱 Android WebView App (Kotlin)

This project is a native Android application developed using Kotlin that utilizes WebView to load and display web content seamlessly within a mobile app. It is designed to convert web applications or websites into a fully functional Android experience while maintaining smooth performance and native integrations.

The app supports essential WebView features such as JavaScript execution, navigation handling, permission management, and interaction between web content and native Android components. It is suitable for business apps, admin panels, dashboards, or any web-based platform that needs a native Android wrapper.

Built with modern Android development practices, this project serves as a solid foundation for integrating web technologies with native Android capabilities using Kotlin.
